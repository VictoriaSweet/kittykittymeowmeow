### **User Story**
As a person who wants to spend more time in nature,
I want to be able to anticipate the weather of nearby parks for the day, hour by hour,

### Base Logic
Pressing search is going to give an option to insert a zip code.
Once a zip code is inserted in the search, a list of nearby parks will show up on the users interface. The user must click on a park in order to see the weather for the day. You decide if it is worth being in the park! ðŸŒ³
